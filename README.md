# blockchain-flask
This blockchain is completely based on the tutorial at https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46. I followed this to develop a better understanding of the blockchain data structure, and plan on using this as a stepping stone for further research and experiments with blockchain and cryptocurrency technology.

The blockchain implemented here uses Flask and can be run as follows:
`python blockchain.py`

Through Flask, this will start a webserver for blockchain interaction.
